# Tox (http://tox.testrun.org/) is a tool for running tests
# in multiple virtualenvs. This configuration file will run the
# test suite on all supported python versions. To use it, "pip install tox"
# and then run "tox" from this directory.

# Note: I've purposefully excluded py30 below, because it has an old version of
# unittest that doesn't have the 2 arg context manager version of
# unittest.TestCase.assertRaises and trying to install unittest2 fails with a
# syntax error
